evo is an evolutionary algorithm library designed using C and pthreads.

On Windows, it requires pthreads-win32.
evo is only planned to be tested under 32-bit environments, since that is all I have access to.

It was created as a final project for CIS*4450: Parallel Programming at the University of Guelph.
However, it might grow into something more if the project idea seems exceptionally promising.
I've not decided yet.

* Get a working prototype by the end of the week.
